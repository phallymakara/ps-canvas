# Contributing to PS Canvas

Thanks for your interest. This page explains how to report problems, propose
changes and send code.

## Before you start

- **Bugs and small fixes**: open an issue or a pull request directly.
- **New parts, new panels, prompt wording, anything larger**: please open an
  issue first so we can agree on the shape of the change before you spend
  time on it. Material 3 Expressive has a specific vocabulary, and the prompt
  is tuned carefully; a short discussion up front saves rework.
- **Questions and ideas**: use [Discussions](https://github.com/phallymakara/ps-canvas/discussions).

## Setting up

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # Vitest unit tests
npm run build      # static export into out/
```

Node 22.12 or newer is required (the test suite needs it); CI uses Node 22. The app is a single Next.js page with no server; everything is stored in the browser.

## Where things live

| Area | Files |
|---|---|
| Part definitions, sizes, corners, theme | `lib/tokens.ts` |
| UI strings and part defaults | `lib/i18n.ts` |
| Drawing a part | `components/M3Node.tsx` |
| Editing a part (desktop / phone) | `components/Inspector.tsx`, `components/Mobile.tsx` |
| Tap-through preview | `components/Preview.tsx` |
| Prompt text | `lib/prompt.ts` |
| Color schemes | `lib/color.ts`, `components/ColorPanel.tsx` |
| Shape / type / motion panels | `components/ThemePanel.tsx` |
| The editor itself | `app/page.tsx` |

### Adding a part

A new kind touches all of these; the existing kinds are the reference:

1. `Kind`, `KIND_SPEC`, `KIND_ORDER` and, if needed, `sizeOf` / `baseRadii` / `iconSlotsOf` in `lib/tokens.ts`
2. `KIND_TEXT` in `lib/i18n.ts`
3. Rendering in `components/M3Node.tsx` (and `MEASURED` / `NO_BOX` when it applies)
4. The item sentence in `itemEn` and a `STYLE_NOTES` entry in `lib/prompt.ts`
5. Any special editor in `components/Inspector.tsx`; tap targets in `components/Preview.tsx` if it is tappable

## Conventions

- Code comments, UI strings, and prompt text are in English.
- Use the standard Material 3 Expressive values (sizes, corners, tokens) and name
  them the way Material does. When in doubt, link the Material page in your PR.
- Keep the editor chrome and the parts on separate paths: parts are drawn from the
  palette tokens only, so they stay correct in dark mode and under every scheme.
- Small, focused pull requests are easier to review than one large one.
- Commit messages are in English and describe the change, not the file.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main` in your fork.
- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` and `npm run build`; CI runs the same three on every PR.
- Fill in the PR template: what changed, why, and how you checked it. Screenshots
  help for anything visual.
- By contributing you agree that your changes are licensed under the project's
  [MIT license](LICENSE).
